               <p><b><i>Ovarian cancer</b></i>  has been coined the "silent killer" due to its lack of notable symptoms until the condition is fairly advanced when it can cause painful intercourse, unexplained weight gain, and more. The average lifetime risk of developing this cancer is just 1.6 percent, but since the disease often goes undetected until it reaches the advanced stages, it is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women.</p> <p>Treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy may be used, though their success decreases the more advanced the disease becomes.</p>

          <li>Unfortunately, we cannot pinpoint exactly what causes ovarian cancer, but researchers have identified several known risk factors for its development. While risk factors are important, it's important to keep in mind that ovarian cancers may occur in people who have no risk factors or family history of the disease. </li><br>
          <li>Risk factors include, but are not limited to, advanced age; Caucasian ethnicity; a family history of ovarian, breast, or colon cancer; obesity; and unopposed estrogen replacement therapy.
</li><br>
          <li>Factors associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer include, but are not limited to having a child before the age of 26, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation surgery, and hysterectomy.</li><br>

            <li>Relative survival rates are a more accurate way to estimate the effect of cancer on survival. These rates compare people with cancer to people in the overall population.</li><br>
            <li>if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific type and stage of cancer is 90%, it means that people who have that cancer are, on average, about 90% as likely as people who donâ€™t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.</li><br>

            <li>The numbers below are among the most current available. But to get 5-year survival rates, doctors look at people who were treated at least 5 years ago. As treatments are improving over time, people who are now being diagnosed with ovarian cancer may have a better outlook than these statistics show.</li><br>
