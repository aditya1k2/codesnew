      <h1 align=center><u>Prostate Cancer</u></h1>
      Prostate cancer is the development of cancer in the prostate,
      a gland in the male reproductive system.Most prostate cancers are slow growing;
      however, some grow relatively quickly.The cancer cells may spread from the
     prostate to other area of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes.
     It may initially cause no symptoms.

       <h1>Signs And Symptoms</h1>
       Early prostate cancer usually has no clear symptoms. Sometimes prostate cancer does cause symptoms,
       often similar to those of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination,
       nocturia (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine,
       hematuria (blood in the urine), and dysuria (painful urination). A study based on the 1998 Patient Care Evaluation
       in the US found that about a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had one or more such symptoms,
       while two-thirds had no symptoms.




 Possible changes include:
<ul>

<li>difficulty starting to urinate or emptying your bladder</li>
<li>a weak flow when you urinate</li>
<li>a feeling that your bladder hasn’t emptied properly</li>
<li>dribbling urine after you finish urinating</li>
<li>needing to urinate more often, especially at night</li>
<li>a sudden urge to urinate – you may sometimes leak before you get to the toilet.</li>
If prostate cancer breaks out of the prostate (locally advanced prostate cancer) or spreads to other parts of the body
(advanced prostate cancer), it can cause other symptoms, including:

<li>back pain, hip pain or pelvis pain</li>
<li>problems getting or keeping an erection</li>
<li>blood in the urine or semen</li>
</ul>
<h1>Causes</h1>
It's not known exactly what causes prostate cancer, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.

These include:
<ul>
<li>age – the risk rises as you get older, and most cases are diagnosed in men over 50 years of age.</li>
<li>ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men of African-Caribbean and African descent than in Asian men.</li>
<li>family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer before age 60 seems to increase your risk of
  developing it; research also shows that having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may
  also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer</li>
<li>obesity – recent research suggests there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer,
  and a balanced diet and regular exercise may lower your risk of developing prostate cancer</li>
<li>diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer,
  and there is some evidence that a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer</li>
</ul>
<h1>Cure</h1>
Doctors use many tests to find, or diagnose, cancer. They also do tests to learn if cancer has spread to another part of the body from where it started. If this happens, it is called metastasis. For example, imaging tests can show if the cancer has spread. Imaging tests show pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors may also do tests to learn which treatments could work best.

For most types of cancer, a biopsy is the only sure way for the doctor to know whether an area of the body has cancer. In a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue for testing in a laboratory. If a biopsy is not possible, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis, but this situation is rare for prostate cancer. For example, a biopsy may not be done when a patient has another medical problem that makes it difficult to do a biopsy, or when a person has a very high PSA level and a bone scan that indicates cancer.

This list describes options for diagnosing this type of cancer. Not all tests listed below are commonly used for every person. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:
<ul>

<li>The type of cancer suspected</li>

<li>Your signs and symptoms</li>

<li>Your age and medical condition</li>

<li>The results of earlier medical tests</li>
</ul>
