      <h1 align=center><u>Prostate Cancer</u></h1>
      Prostate cancer is the development of cancer in the prostate,
      a gland in the male reproductive system.Most prostate cancers are slow growing;
      however, some grow relatively quickly.The cancer cells may spread from the
     prostate to other area of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes.
     It may initially cause no symptoms.In later stages, it can lead to difficulty urinating,
     blood in the urine or pain in the pelvis, back, or when urinating.A disease known as benign prostatic
      hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms.Other late symptoms may include
       feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells.
       Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include older age,
       a family history of the disease, and race.About 99% of cases occur in males over the age of 50.
       Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold.
       In the United States, it is more common in the African American population than the White American population.
       Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat or milk products or low in certain vegetables.
       An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified.
       An increased risk is associated with the BRCA mutations.
       Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy.
       Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
       <h1>Signs And Symptoms</h1>
       Early prostate cancer usually has no clear symptoms. Sometimes prostate cancer does cause symptoms,
       often similar to those of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination,
       nocturia (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine,
       hematuria (blood in the urine), and dysuria (painful urination). A study based on the 1998 Patient Care Evaluation
       in the US found that about a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had one or more such symptoms,
       while two-thirds had no symptoms.
       Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra.
       Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function.
       Because the vas deferens deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra,
        and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content,
        prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance,
         such as difficulty achieving erection or painful ejaculation.
         Metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body can cause additional symptoms.
         The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), pelvis, or ribs.
         Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal or nearby part of the bone.
         Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing tingling, leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence.
         <h1>What are the symptoms of the Prostate cancer?</h1>
         Most men with early prostate cancer don’t have any signs or symptoms.

One reason for this is the way the cancer grows.
You’ll usually only get early symptoms if the cancer grows near the tube you urinate through (the urethra) and presses against it,
 changing the way you urinate (pee). But because prostate cancer usually starts to grow in a different part of the prostate,
early prostate cancer doesn’t often press on the urethra and cause symptoms.

If you do notice changes in the way you urinate, this is more likely to be a sign of a very common non-cancerous problem
called an enlarged prostate, or another health problem. But it’s still a good idea to get it checked out. Possible changes include:
<ul>

<li>difficulty starting to urinate or emptying your bladder</li>
<li>a weak flow when you urinate</li>
<li>a feeling that your bladder hasn’t emptied properly</li>
<li>dribbling urine after you finish urinating</li>
<li>needing to urinate more often, especially at night</li>
<li>a sudden urge to urinate – you may sometimes leak before you get to the toilet.</li>
If prostate cancer breaks out of the prostate (locally advanced prostate cancer) or spreads to other parts of the body
(advanced prostate cancer), it can cause other symptoms, including:

<li>back pain, hip pain or pelvis pain</li>
<li>problems getting or keeping an erection</li>
<li>blood in the urine or semen</li>
</ul>
<h1>Causes</h1>
It's not known exactly what causes prostate cancer, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.

These include:
<ul>
<li>age – the risk rises as you get older, and most cases are diagnosed in men over 50 years of age.</li>
<li>ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men of African-Caribbean and African descent than in Asian men.</li>
<li>family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer before age 60 seems to increase your risk of
  developing it; research also shows that having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may
  also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer</li>
<li>obesity – recent research suggests there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer,
  and a balanced diet and regular exercise may lower your risk of developing prostate cancer</li>
<li>diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer,
  and there is some evidence that a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer</li>
</ul>
<h1>Cure</h1>
Doctors use many tests to find, or diagnose, cancer. They also do tests to learn if cancer has spread to another part of the body from where it started. If this happens, it is called metastasis. For example, imaging tests can show if the cancer has spread. Imaging tests show pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors may also do tests to learn which treatments could work best.

For most types of cancer, a biopsy is the only sure way for the doctor to know whether an area of the body has cancer. In a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue for testing in a laboratory. If a biopsy is not possible, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis, but this situation is rare for prostate cancer. For example, a biopsy may not be done when a patient has another medical problem that makes it difficult to do a biopsy, or when a person has a very high PSA level and a bone scan that indicates cancer.

This list describes options for diagnosing this type of cancer. Not all tests listed below are commonly used for every person. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:
<ul>

<li>The type of cancer suspected</li>

<li>Your signs and symptoms</li>

<li>Your age and medical condition</li>

<li>The results of earlier medical tests</li>
</ul>
