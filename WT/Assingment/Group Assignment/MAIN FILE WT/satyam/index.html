<p style="color:white; text-align:center;font-size:160%; ">Cancer starts when cells in the body start to grow out<br>
of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can <br>
become cancer,and spread to other areas of the body.<br>

Bile duct cancer starts in a bile duct. To understands <br>
this cancer,it helps to know about the bile ducts and <br>
what they normally do.</p><hr><br>

<h2 style="color:red;font-size:200%;text-align:center"> About the bile ducts</h2>
<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center">
The bile ducts are a series of thin tubes that go from the liver to the small intestine. Their major job is to move a fluid called <br>
BILE from the liver and gallbladder into small intestine, where it helps digest the fats in food. <br>
Different parts of the bile duct system have different names. In the liver it begins as many tiny tubes (called ductules) where bile collects from the liver cells. <br>
The ductules come together to form tubes called small ducts. These merge into larger ducts and then the left and right hepatic ducts.<br>
 All of these ducts within the liver are called intrahepatic bile ducts.<br>

The left and right hepatic ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct in an area called the hilum.<br>
 Lower down, the gallbladder (a small organ that stores bile) is joined to the common hepatic duct by a small duct called the cystic duct.<br>
 This combined duct is called the common bile duct. The common bile duct passes through part of the pancreas before it joins with the <br>
pancreatic duct and empties into the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum) at the ampulla of Vater.

<h3 style="color:red;font-size:200%;text-align:center"> Types of bile duct cancers by location</h3>
<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center">
Cancer can start in any part of the bile duct system.<br>
 Based on where the cancers are (see the picture below), they're grouped into 3 types:<br><br>
<img src="c2.JPG" align="center" height="250px" width="200px">
1.) Intrahepatic bile duct cancers<br><br>
2.) Perihilar (also called hilar) bile duct cancers <br><br>
3.) Distal bile duct cancers<br><br>

<h4 style="color:red;font-size:200%;text-align:center"> Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer </h4>
<p style="color:white;font-size:160%;text-align:center">A rare cancer that forms in the bile ducts inside the liver. <br>
A bile duct is a tube that carries bile (fluid made by the liver) between the liver and <br>
 gallbladder and the small intestine. <br>
Only a small number of bile duct cancers are intrahepatic.<br>
